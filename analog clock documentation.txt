				Creating Analog Clock with HTML,CSS&JAVASCRIPT
STEP1=========create html==========
In your HTML create a parent div and give it an an ID/class name[clock]. Then create the children div which would be the hands of the clock.
thereafter we should have a secondHand, minuteHand & hourHand. Also create div's which would contain the numbers to be inside the clock[1-12].
note: the total child div's should amount to 15.
STEP2========design clock with css===========
After linking your css file to your html document, Style the body of the page to your taste.
Give the clock div WIDTH and HEIGHT of the same size so it forms a square.With a border of 3px solid black and border radius  of 100%, the square
should now become a circle with a black border around it. Set the position of the clock to relative. 
Call the class names of all the numbers and set the position to absolute,width and height to 100% so that it takes the width and height of the clock, text-align should be center. Among the styling we are going to declare a transform:rotate variable (transform:rotate(var(--rotation)); and set rotate to 0(rotate:0;). Using this variable we are going to rotate the numbers around the clock, call the individual id/class names 
of the numbers and use the variable that was created and specify the deg of rotation we wish to apply e.g (--rotation:30deg-330deg;).
style each hand of the clock differently. call together the id/class names of the hands and set position to absolute and transform origin BOTTOM[this
holds the hand at the bottom while they rotate round the clock]. 
Also set the rotate to calculate our rotation variable by 1 deg[ rotate(calc(var(--rotation)*1deg));
Create hand holder and set in in the middle of the clock.

STEP3=========start  working clock with javascript============
You need to pay rapt attention to this part of the code.
Set the interval of the clock and call the function name we are to use and the timing you want inside the interval function.
Create three constants or variables secondHand,minuteHand&hourHand and link them to the HTML divs for the hand of the  clock using document.querySelector.
Inside the setClock function Create a constant and attach NEW DATE function to it. The new date function helps to get the recent date of the system..
Create another constant called secondsRatio and get seconds from the new date
Do same for minutesRatio, then add secondsRatio to it and divide by 60
Do same for hourRatio, add minutesRatio and divide by 12
Create a function name e.g setRotation(). Store the secondHand and secondRatio in the function. Call the same function and store the minutesHand and minutesRatio in it. Do same for hourHand and hourRatio.
Call function setRotation and represent the hands and ratios with parameters e.g setRotation(element,rotationRatio);
Inside the function setRotation our element which represents the hands of the clock is styled and property set to multiply rotationRatio by 360 { element.style.setProperty("name of css var",rotation ratio*360)} this uses the rotation variable to calculate the movement of the hands of the clock.

After all these call the function setClock();
